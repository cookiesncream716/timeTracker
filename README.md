# Tixit: timeTracker

![Example of TimeTracker](https://github.com/cookiesncream716/timeTracker/blob/master/tTracker.png?raw=true)

This is a plugin for [Tixit](https://tixit.me/) which allows users to record the time they have spent working on a ticket. They are able to choose from two options of how to recore their time. They can use it like a timer, entering a start and stop time, or just enter the total minutes worked on a particular day. It will also display a table showing which users worked which days for how long and show how much total time has been worked for that ticket.
